# DoubleDoors
DoubleDoors is a PocketMine-MP plugin that enhances the behavior of interactive blocks like doors, trapdoors, and fence gates. With this plugin, players can seamlessly open or close connected blocks of the same type, mimicking double-door mechanics and recursive opening for nearby structures.
